# Policy-on-ODZ-CB-upgrade
This web map is the updated version of Policy-on-ODZ-CB, previously published on GitHub. It displays the spatial distributions of four variables on the EMD level in Chungbuk, Korea. The four variables include the rate of population change between 2010 and 2020, the number of workers per 1,000 population, the number of population over 65 per 100 population under 14, and the index of development, a composite index that is constructed from combining the scaled values of the aforementioned three variables. To see the spatial figure of a specific variable, expand the icon of map layers in the upper-right corner on the map and uncheck the boxes before the name of the layer except the box before the layer you want to see. The first layer contains the locations and names of cities and counties, the second layer the locations and names of EMDs, which are similar to the census blocks in the US. The rest of four layers corresponds to the four variables mentioned earlier.
